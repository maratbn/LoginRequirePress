  LoginRequirePress -- WordPress plugin that allows site administrators to
                       selectively require user login to view a specific page
                       or post, thereby preventing unregistered site visitors
                       from reading the corresponding page content, limiting
                       access only to registered users with subscriber roles
                       and above.  Plugin also filters out the selected posts
                       from the site's feeds.
